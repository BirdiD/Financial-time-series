# Financial-time-series
Stock markets are an essential component of the economy.  Their prediction naturally arouses afascination in the academic and financial world.  Indeed, financial time series, due to their widerange application fields, have seen numerous studies being published for their prediction. Some ofthese studies aim to establish whether there is a strong and predictive link between macroeconomicindicators and stock market trends and thus predict market returns. Stock market prediction howeverremains a challenging task due to uncertain noise.  To what extent can macroeconomic indicatorsbe strong predictors of stock price ? Can they be used for stock trends modeling ? To answer thesequestions, we will focus on several time series forecasting models.  We will on the one hand usestatistical time series models, more specifically the most commonly used time series approachesfor stock prediction :  the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), the GeneralizedAutoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR)approach.  On the other hand, we will be using two deep learning models :  the Long-Short TermMemory (LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for our prediction task. In the final section ofthis paper, we look directly at companies to detect trends
